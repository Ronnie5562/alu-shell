## Requirements
#### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: `chmod u+x file`. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
