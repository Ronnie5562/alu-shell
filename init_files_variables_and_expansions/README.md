## Requirements
**General**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`$ wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use `&&`, `||`, or `;`
- You are not allowed to use `bc`, `sed`, or `awk`
- All your files must be executable
**More Info**
Read your /etc/profile, /etc/inputrc and ~/.bashrc files.
Look at some files in the /etc/profile.d directory.
Note: You do not have to learn about awk, tar, bzip2, date, scp, ulimit, umask, or shell scripting, yet.
